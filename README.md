============ Video Telephone ============

Our goal is to create an IOS app that allows users to emulate the game telephone by sending each other videos. The game begins when a user takes a video of themselves (up to 6 seconds) and sends it to a friend. That friend can see the video they have been sent. They take a response video and send that to a 3rd user. The 3rd user can only see the most recent video in this chain until they make a response video. After they've made a response they can see all of the videos in the chain. Endless fun.
